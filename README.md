# Fake-AI-Image-Detection-System

A complete Fake AI Image Detection System using deep learning. 

Upload any image to detect if it was generated by AI models like Midjourney or Stable Diffusion. Our deep learning system analyzes pixel artifacts invisible to the human eye.


# Fake AI Image Detection System

This project implements a Deep Learning system to classify images as "Real" or "AI-Generated" using a Vision Transformer (ViT). It includes a full training pipeline and a web interface for easy usage.

## Project Structure

- `ai_system/`: Contains the Python core logic.
  - `train.py`: Script to train the ViT model.
  - `evaluate.py`: Script to evaluate the model on a test set.
  - `inference.py`: Script used by the web app to classify images.
  - `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `server/`: Node.js backend handling file uploads and calling the Python inference script.
- `client/`: React frontend.
- `dataset/`: Directory for your training data (not included).

## Dataset Setup

To train the model, you must organize your dataset as follows:

```
dataset/
├── train/
│   ├── real/      # Real images
│   └── fake/      # AI-generated images
├── val/
│   ├── real/
│   └── fake/
└── test/
    ├── real/
    └── fake/
```

We recommend a balanced dataset (50% Real, 50% Fake).

## Training the Model

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r ai_system/requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the training script:
   ```bash
   python3 ai_system/train.py
   ```
   This will train the model and save the best checkpoint to `ai_system/best_model.pth`.

## Evaluation

To evaluate the trained model on the test set:
```bash
python3 ai_system/evaluate.py
```
This will output accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and a confusion matrix.

## Web Application

The web application allows you to upload images and get immediate classification results.

- If a trained model (`ai_system/best_model.pth`) exists, it will use it.
- **Demo Mode**: If no model is found, the system runs in a deterministic "Demo Mode" for testing the UI.

### Running the App
The app runs automatically in the Replit environment.
- Frontend: React + Vite
- Backend: Express + Python Inference

## Model Details

- **Architecture**: Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) pretrained on ImageNet.
- **Fine-tuning**: The classification head is replaced for binary classification (Real vs Fake).
- **Augmentation**: Random crops, flips, color jitter, and Gaussian noise are used during training to improve robustness.

## Limitations

- Performance depends heavily on the diversity of the training data (e.g., covering Midjourney, Stable Diffusion, DALL-E).
- Compression artifacts (JPEG) can affect detection accuracy.
- The "Demo Mode" is for UI demonstration only and does not perform real analysis.
